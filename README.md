Assignment 4 of the Treehouse Data Analysis Techdegree program.

This was definitely a challenging project as I am still learning SQLAlchemy, which was used to make this project. Below are links that I used for help in certain parts of the project:

This is where I learned to remove the dollar sign ($) from the prices when cleaning up the data: https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/python-remove-character-from-string

This is where I learned to join both tables together in order to query the brand's table to get a brand's name using its ID: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy_orm_working_with_joins.htm

This is where I learned about func.count(): https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/group-by-and-count-function-in-sqlalchemy/
